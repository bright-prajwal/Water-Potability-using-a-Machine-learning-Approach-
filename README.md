# Water-Potability-using-a-Machine-learning-Approach-
To accurately classify water samples as potable (safe for drinking) or non-potable based on chemical  and physical parameters such as pH, Hardness, Solids, Chloramines, Sulphate, Conductivity, Organic  Carbon, Trihalomethanes, and Turbidity.

# Objectives 
The objectives of the proposed system are as follows: 
  1. To accurately classify water samples as potable (safe for drinking) or non-potable based on chemical 
and physical parameters such as pH, Hardness, Solids, Chloramines, Sulphate, Conductivity, Organic 
Carbon, Trihalomethanes, and Turbidity. 
  2. To identify and analyse the key water quality parameters that have the most significant impact on 
water potability through exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualization techniques. 
  3. To evaluate and compare the performance of various machine learning models, such as Random 
Forest, XGBoost, K-Nearest Neighbors, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and AdaBoost, to 
determine the most accurate model for predicting water potability. 
  4. To optimize the best-performing model using hyperparameter tuning techniques for improved 
prediction accuracy and reliability. 
  5. To provide insights and recommendations for water quality management by presenting the results in 
a clear, interactive, and user-friendly format, assisting decision-makers and researchers.

# Dataset 
The dataset contains information about various water quality parameters used to determine whether water 
is potable (safe to drink) or non-potable (unsafe). It was sourced from Kaggle and consists of the 
following attributes: 
1. Numerical Features: 
  1. PH: pH value of water, indicating acidity or alkalinity. Safe drinking water typically has pH 
values between 6.5 and 8.5.
  2. Hardness: Measures the calcium and magnesium salts in water, affecting taste and scaling of 
pipes. 
 3. Solids (TDS): Total dissolved solids present in water. High TDS may indicate contamination. 
 4. Chloramines: Disinfectant used to treat water. Excess levels can be harmful. 
 5. Sulphate: High sulphate levels can cause water to have a bitter taste and may lead to health 
issues. 
 6. Conductivity: Ability of water to conduct electricity, related to dissolved ion concentration. 
 7. Organic carbon: Organic matter present in water, which can indicate pollution. 
 8. Trihalomethanes: Chemical compounds that may form as by-products of water disinfection. 
 9. Turbidity: Measure of water clarity. High turbidity may indicate contamination.
 
2. Target Variable:  
o Potability 
• 1 → Potable (Safe for drinking) 
• 0 → Non-potable (Unsafe for drinking)
