# Water-Potability-using-a-Machine-learning-Approach-
To accurately classify water samples as potable (safe for drinking) or non-potable based on chemical  and physical parameters such as pH, Hardness, Solids, Chloramines, Sulphate, Conductivity, Organic  Carbon, Trihalomethanes, and Turbidity.

# Objectives 
The objectives of the proposed system are as follows: 
  1. To accurately classify water samples as potable (safe for drinking) or non-potable based on chemical 
and physical parameters such as pH, Hardness, Solids, Chloramines, Sulphate, Conductivity, Organic 
Carbon, Trihalomethanes, and Turbidity. 
  2. To identify and analyse the key water quality parameters that have the most significant impact on 
water potability through exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualization techniques. 
  3. To evaluate and compare the performance of various machine learning models, such as Random 
Forest, XGBoost, K-Nearest Neighbors, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and AdaBoost, to 
determine the most accurate model for predicting water potability. 
  4. To optimize the best-performing model using hyperparameter tuning techniques for improved 
prediction accuracy and reliability. 
  5. To provide insights and recommendations for water quality management by presenting the results in 
a clear, interactive, and user-friendly format, assisting decision-makers and researchers.
